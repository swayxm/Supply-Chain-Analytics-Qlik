Repository Description
Overview:
This project, titled "Supply Chain Analytics Using Qlik Sense," is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain management through the use of advanced data analytics and interactive visualizations. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear, actionable insights that facilitate better decision-making, reduce lead times, and minimize transportation costs.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to harness the power of data to optimize various facets of supply chain management. By analyzing historical data and implementing real-time analytics, we aim to improve logistics operations, forecasting, and inventory management. This will lead to improved operational efficiency, reduced costs, and better responsiveness to market changes.

Technical Architecture:
The technical architecture of this project involves:

Data Source Integration: Collecting data from diverse supply chain databases and systems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all relevant information.
Data Processing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Qlik Sense Platform: Utilizing Qlik Sense for its advanced data visualization and analytics capabilities.
User Interface: Developing interactive and intuitive dashboards that provide users with real-time insights and facilitate informed decision-making.
Business Requirements:

Implement a robust data integration strategy to aggregate and centralize data from diverse supply chain sources.
Utilize Qlik's advanced visualization capabilities to create intuitive and dynamic dashboards.
Analyze historical logistics data to identify patterns and optimize transportation routes.
Implement real-time tracking and monitoring solutions to enhance visibility into the movement of goods.
Facilitate quick decision-making through real-time analytics in response to unforeseen events or changes in demand.
Data Collection & Preparation:
Data was collected from various supply chain sources and included detailed information on product shipment, customer demographics, sales, order details, and more. The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure it was ready for visualization and analysis in Qlik Sense.

Visualizations:
A series of interactive visualizations were created to analyze different aspects of supply chain performance, including:

Total Items Placed by Customers in Different Countries
Total Items Placed by State
Customer Segment Analysis
Mode of Payment Distribution
Customer Purchases by City
Delivery Status of Orders
Benefit per Order Analysis
Profit Ratio Analysis
Market Analysis
Order Region Distribution
Dashboard:
The final dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and responsive, combining all the visualizations into a comprehensive tool for supply chain analysis. Filter panes were added to allow users to explore the data dynamically, providing a tailored view of the information relevant to their needs.

Performance Testing:
Performance testing was conducted to ensure the dashboard loads quickly and responds efficiently to user interactions. Data queries were optimized, and efficient data models were used to maintain smooth performance.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the transformative potential of data-driven insights in supply chain management. By leveraging Qlik Sense, we have created a powerful tool that enhances visibility, improves decision-making, and optimizes operational efficiency. This repository includes all steps from data collection to visualization and performance testing, providing a comprehensive guide to replicating and building upon this project.
